    <h2>Amber Tracy</h2>
    <h2>No Nick-name</h2>
    <p> I am married with a one and a half year old son. I'm a stay at home mom/wife where I take care of the house work (or atlest I try to) while my husband works. I love to draw and now I'm starting to get into painting and sometimes I like to sell them if I can. I am super friendly and a hard worker.</p>
