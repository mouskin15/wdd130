            Meet Stephen Todd Tracy, who goes by Stephentodd, began at the age of 14 doing gigs around Las Vegas. It was through 
            this work and love of music he decided to make music his life. After Leaving Brigham Young University in 2013, 
            he returned home to Las Vegas to work with Mr. Martin a multi platinum producer. Through this internship he learned 
            how to understand a market, find a demographic and most importantly produce a hit song. 
            He often says, “I was blessed to work with such large artist at such a young age.” After that he went to work at 
            another multiplatinum studio before opening his own with his father. Since opening his own studio Stephentodd has 
            won multiple awards and had multiple songs break the top 40 on the billboard charts.
