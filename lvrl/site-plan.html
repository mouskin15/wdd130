        A Business Focused Space
          Las Vegas Record Lab is a personal boutique studio hand built by Steve for the highest quality.  
          It runs off of the top-of-the-line industry standard equipment. The DAW is Protools 12.  
          If you have worked before but not on Protools never fear, we can happily convert any of your sessions 
          in a Protools file for you. We pride ourselves in our affordable nature as we keep the focus on the creation 
          and marketing of music and not on huge spaces that are mainly used for show and not for function. 
          Its through this focus we have been able to compete with the “big boys” in Las Vegas (and even beat them!) 
          while keeping our costs often one half of theirs.

        How to Start with Us
         Do you a song you want to record? Do you have an idea of a song? Do you just want a high-quality 
         recording of yourself singing your favorite song?  Do you want us to write you a hit song? 
         If you said yes to any of these, we are the studio for you. We work with a wide range of clients 
         on a wide range of projects. We have beginners and teens getting their first studio experience, 
         we have Las Vegas musicians who have been in the game for years finishing their demos and we have o
         riginal artists making ready songs to get signed by major labels and we will be your guide and partner too!
         Just give us a call and our producers will gladly talk with you about your project and we will get you started 
         and most importantly moving forward.

        Common Packages
          We customize everyones studio experience too fit their particular needs and goals. 
          While this is true, if your confused where you want to begin here are three easy categories too choose from:  
          1)	The Record Lab Experience - This is where you tell us a famous song you would like to sing or make your own 
              and we make the track for you, record your voice on it and fix it up with all the studio magic to make it rival a star. 
              This package is usually best for social media because covering famous songs will bring people to your page where they can 
              find your other music. This is also a favorite of those looking to books gigs, first timers to a studio or as a birthday present.
          
          2)	Demo -  The demo is for original songwriters and artists who want a fantastic recording either of an original song 
              or an original cover (a famous song that is changed significantly).  This is a less expensive production because it has 
              everything it needs to be a beautiful song but does not go as crazy as a radio ready production. 
              Examples of this can be a beautiful acoustic version of a famous song with lovely harmonies or a song with a full band 
              (guitar, bass, drums, keys and voice) but does have two or three back up singers and horns. 
              Demos are usually used for social media or to sell a song or artist to a label. 
          
          3)	Radio Ready - If you are trying to be a famous artist this is the one for you. This is where all the magic is mixed together 
              to make a masterpiece.  Radio Ready refers to a song that is made to such high quality that it is ready to go on the radio today 
              and go up against all the big names.
